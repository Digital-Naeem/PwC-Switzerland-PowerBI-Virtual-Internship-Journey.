Now, I‚Äôm excited to talk you through each task‚Äîsharing the **insights, challenges, and learnings** I gained along the way.  

**Let‚Äôs dive in!**   

# [ Task 1: Call Centre Trend in PhoneNow Company ] --->

As part of this task, I was assigned to build a **detailed and insightful Power BI dashboard** for **PhoneNow**, a leading telecommunications company.  

##  Goal  
Provide managers with a **clear visual understanding** of key **call centre trends** through **effective and intuitive data visualization**.  

##  Key Focus Areas  
- **Monitoring call volumes**  
- **Evaluating agent efficiency**  
- **Tracking customer satisfaction**  

The dashboard was designed to deliver **meaningful and actionable insights**, with an emphasis on **simplicity, clarity, and supporting fast, data-driven decisions**.  

###  Task Brief  
Here‚Äôs the **task brief** I received via email:
![Pwc Task 1  mails 1 image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8149436e-6a53-4f82-a2bc-b86d54528ffb)


##  KPI Analysis for Task 1  

As highlighted in the **task email**, I was required to reflect **all key performance indicators (KPIs)** from the dataset. After **analyzing the data**, I identified the **most relevant KPIs** for this dashboard, including:  

###  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
- **Total number of calls**  
- **Answered Calls and Abandoned Calls**  
- **Resolved Calls**  
- **Average speed of answer**  
- **Length of calls (duration)**  
- **Overall customer satisfaction rating**  

###  My Extra Work  
- **Agent Statistics quadrant**  
- **Agents‚Äô call handling efficiency**  
- **Every agent's performance, visualized by charts**  

###  Final Dashboard Preview  
And here‚Äôs a **quick view of my final dashboard for Task 1**:
![pwc task 1 Call Centre Dashboard image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca6916d0-65c0-474f-a18e-e8ed85e99c2b)

##  Dashboard Overview  

I completed all the required tasks and ensured the dashboard remained **simple and user-friendly**, especially for managers.  

###  Key Features  
- **Filters on the left** for easy data exploration and quick decision-making.  
- Enables **agents to track their own performance** efficiently.  

##  Insights from the Dashboard  
- **Total Calls Handled:** 5,000  
- **Abandonment Rate:** 18.92% _(needs urgent attention)_  
- **Average Customer Satisfaction Score:** 3.40 _(reflects mixed feedback)_  
- **Issues Resolved:** 73% _(indicating a need for faster call handling)_  

---

##  Step 1: Import and Transform Data  

Before loading data into **Power BI**, I used **Power Query** for **data cleaning and preparation**, ensuring:  
- Removal of unnecessary columns and rows.  
- Verification of data types.  
- Readiness of all fields for analysis.  

This step was **crucial for reliable and accurate insights**. 

##  Step 2: Enhance Columns with DAX  

Many columns contained **binary or unclear values**, making interpretation difficult. To resolve this, I created **calculated columns using DAX** to replace them with **descriptive labels**, making the data more accessible for **managers and analysts**.  

###  Example DAX Transformations  
```DAX
Total Calls = COUNT(Sheet1[Call Id])  
Answered = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Call Id]), FILTER(Sheet1, Sheet1[Answered (Y/N)]="Y"))  
Resolved (Y) = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Call Id]), FILTER(Sheet1, Sheet1[Resolved]="Y"))  
Avg. Calls Resolved = Sheet1[Resolved (Y)] / Sheet1[Total Calls] * 100  
Abandoned (Not answered) = CALCULATE(Sheet1[Total Calls] - Sheet1[Answered])  
Call Length üìû = AVERAGE(Sheet1[AvgTalkDuration]) * 24 * 60  

// OR  
Avg. Length of call üìû (M) = MINUTE(Sheet1[AvgTalkDuration]) + SECOND(Sheet1[AvgTalkDuration]) / 60 
```

##  Step 3: Data Visualization  

Using **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**, I designed a **dashboard** focused on key **KPIs**, ensuring clarity and actionable insights.  

###  Key Metrics Displayed  
- **Total calls**, **answered calls**, **resolved calls**, and **abandoned calls**  
- **Average calls resolved**  
- **Average speed of answer (seconds)**  
- **Call length (minutes)**  
- **Overall customer satisfaction**  
- **Agents' call handling efficiency**  
- **Agent Statistics quadrant**  
- **Every agent's performance visualized by charts**  

---

##  Step 4: Data Analysis with Measures  

I developed **DAX measures** to calculate **critical metrics**, enabling clear **visual insights** on the dashboard.  

###  Key DAX Measures  
- **Percentage of calls answered**  
- **Total calls answered vs. missed (Abandoned)**  
- **Issues resolved**  
- **Length of calls**  

These measures helped structure the data for **actionable insights** and **efficient decision-making**.  

##  Key Insights from Dashboard  

- **Average Satisfaction Rating:** 3.40  
- **Total Calls:** 5,000  
- **Total Calls Answered:** 4,054  
- **Issues Resolved:** 3,646  
- **Abandoned Calls:** 946  
- **Average Call Duration:** 3.75 minutes  
- **Fastest Average Speed of Answer:** 67.52 seconds  

###  Agent Performance  
- **Top Performer:** Jim, with **536 calls answered**  
- **Lowest Calls Answered:** Stewart, with **477 calls**  
- **Most Rated Agent:** Martha, **3.47 rating**  


##  Dashboard Design  

I designed the dashboard with a **clean color palette** from **COLORS website** and applied **creative visualization** to ensure clarity and ease of interpretation.  
This dashboard doesn‚Äôt just **display data**‚Äîit **tells the story** of call center performance in a clear and meaningful way.

I hope this gives you a **clear idea of my process and results**. Now, **let‚Äôs move on to the second task!**

# [ Task 2: Customer Retention Dashboard (Step-by-Step Explanation) ] --->

##  Problem Statement  

A few weeks after presenting the **previous dashboard**, I was contacted directly by the **Retention Manager** of the telecom company.  

They appreciated my **previous report** and said:
![Pwc Task 2 mail 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b2665b5-b577-4bc7-8acc-03c5beaa5c3f)

			
				
##  Problem Statement  

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to acquire customers‚Äîwe don‚Äôt want to lose them.‚Äù  

> ‚ÄúCurrently, we reach out to customers only after they terminate their contracts ‚Äî which is a reactionary approach.‚Äù  

> ‚ÄúWe want to identify at-risk customers in advance, so we can proactively engage them.‚Äù  

> ‚ÄúOur Excel-based analysis hasn‚Äôt yielded meaningful insights.‚Äù  

> ‚ÄúWe need a dashboard that is clear, visual, and management-friendly.‚Äù

##  Objectives  

The **PwC Engagement Partner** outlined three **key responsibilities** for me:  

1. **Define the most important KPIs** related to customer retention.  
2. **Build an interactive, insight-driven dashboard** using **Power BI**.  
3. **Write a short email/report** summarizing **key insights and actionable recommendations**.  

##  Step-by-Step Work I Performed   

###  Step 1: Uploading the Dataset  
The dataset was provided by the **PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship**.  

 **Dataset Overview:**  
- **Total Rows:** 7,043  
- **Total Columns:** 23  
- Included **customer demographics, account info, services, and churn status**.  

---

###  Step 2: Data Cleaning (In Power Query)  
The dataset was loaded into **Power BI Desktop** and refined through **Power Query**.  

 **Fixed incorrect data types** _(e.g., text instead of number)_  
 **Removed null values and redundant rows**  
 **Cleaned and structured the dataset for analysis**  

---

###  Step 3: Data Transformation & Modelling  
 **Organized Data Structure:**  
- **Primary table:** ‚Äò01 Churn-Dataset‚Äô _(cleaned and prepared data)_  
- **Separate table:** ‚ÄòAll Measures‚Äô _(managed all KPIs and DAX measures)_  

---

##  Step 4: DAX Measures (KPIs & Feature-Level Analysis)  
To make the dashboard **smart and dynamic**, I created the following **important DAX Measures**: 
![Pwc Task 2 measure image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7827b831-477b-4846-a68a-3742f6a12bc1)
