## 🔧 Step 1: Import and Transform Data  

Before loading data into **Power BI**, I used **Power Query** for **data cleaning and preparation**, ensuring:  
✔ Removal of unnecessary columns and rows.  
✔ Verification of data types.  
✔ Readiness of all fields for analysis.  

This step was **crucial for reliable and accurate insights**. 

## 🛠 Step 2: Enhance Columns with DAX  

Many columns contained **binary or unclear values**, making interpretation difficult. To resolve this, I created **calculated columns using DAX** to replace them with **descriptive labels**, making the data more accessible for **managers and analysts**.  

### 📌 Example DAX Transformations  
```DAX
Total Calls = COUNT(Sheet1[Call Id])  
Answered = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Call Id]), FILTER(Sheet1, Sheet1[Answered (Y/N)]="Y"))  
Resolved (Y) = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Call Id]), FILTER(Sheet1, Sheet1[Resolved]="Y"))  
Avg. Calls Resolved = Sheet1[Resolved (Y)] / Sheet1[Total Calls] * 100  
Abandoned (Not answered) = CALCULATE(Sheet1[Total Calls] - Sheet1[Answered])  
Call Length 📞 = AVERAGE(Sheet1[AvgTalkDuration]) * 24 * 60  

// OR  
Avg. Length of call 📞 (M) = MINUTE(Sheet1[AvgTalkDuration]) + SECOND(Sheet1[AvgTalkDuration]) / 60 
```

## 🎨 Step 3: Data Visualization  

Using **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**, I designed a **dashboard** focused on key **KPIs**, ensuring clarity and actionable insights.  

### 🔍 Key Metrics Displayed  
📌 **Total calls**, **answered calls**, **resolved calls**, and **abandoned calls**  
📌 **Average calls resolved**  
📌 **Average speed of answer (seconds)**  
📌 **Call length (minutes)**  
📌 **Overall customer satisfaction**  
📌 **Agents' call handling efficiency**  
📌 **Agent Statistics quadrant**  
📌 **Every agent's performance visualized by charts**

## 📊 Step 4: Data Analysis with Measures  

I developed **DAX measures** to calculate **critical metrics**, enabling clear **visual insights** on the dashboard.  

### ⚡ Key DAX Measures  
✅ **Percentage of calls answered**  
✅ **Total calls answered vs. missed (Abandoned)**  
✅ **Issues resolved**  
✅ **Length of calls**  

These measures helped structure the data for **actionable insights** and **efficient decision-making**.  

## 🔍 Key Insights from Dashboard  

📊 **Average Satisfaction Rating:** 3.40  
📞 **Total Calls:** 5,000  
✅ **Total Calls Answered:** 4,054  
⚡ **Issues Resolved:** 3,646  
🚫 **Abandoned Calls:** 946  
⏳ **Average Call Duration:** 3.75 minutes  
⚡ **Fastest Average Speed of Answer:** 67.52 seconds  

### 🏆 Agent Performance  
🥇 **Top Performer:** Jim, with **536 calls answered**  
🥉 **Lowest Calls Answered:** Stewart, with **477 calls**  
⭐ **Most Rated Agent:** Martha, **3.47 rating**

## 🎨 Dashboard Design  

I designed the dashboard with a **clean color palette** from **COLORS website** and applied **creative visualization** to ensure clarity and ease of interpretation.  

This dashboard doesn’t just **display data**—it **tells the story** of call center performance in a clear and meaningful way.
